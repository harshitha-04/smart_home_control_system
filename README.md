# Smart Home Digital Twin - README

## Overview
This project is a 3D interactive digital twin of a smart home, built using Three.js. It allows users to control various smart home devices and visualize their effects in a realistic 3D environment.

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Environment**: Navigate through the smart home using keyboard controls
- **Smart Home Controls**:
  - Ceiling lights (on/off with adjustable intensity)
  - LED panel lights (on/off with adjustable intensity)
  - AC unit (on/off with temperature control)
  - Ceiling fan (multiple speed settings)
  - TV & speakers system
  - Wall sconce lights
  - Disco lights with adjustable speed
  - Smart plant watering system with moisture monitoring
  - Motorized curtains with color selection
- **Realistic Visual Effects**:
  - Dynamic lighting
  - Animated devices (fan blades, TV effects, disco lights)
  - Interactive plant watering system
  - Opening/closing curtains

## How to Use
1. Open the HTML file in a modern web browser
2. Use the control panel on the left to interact with smart home devices
3. Navigate the 3D environment using keyboard controls:
   - **W/S**: Move forward/backward
   - **A/D**: Move left/right
   - **Arrow Keys**: Look around
   - **Q/E**: Look up/down
   - **Page Up/Down**: Zoom in/out

## Technical Details
- Built with Three.js (r128)
- Uses WebGL for hardware-accelerated 3D rendering
- Responsive design that adapts to window size
- Physics-based lighting and materials
- Interactive controls with visual feedback

## Requirements
- Modern web browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Internet connection (for loading Three.js from CDN)

## Future Enhancements
- Add more smart home devices (security system, smart appliances)
- Implement voice control integration
- Add day/night cycle
- Improve mobile device support
