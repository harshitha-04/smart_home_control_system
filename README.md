# Smart Home 3D Simulation

A 3D interactive smart home simulation built with Three.js, where you can control lights, fan, TV, and AC in a virtual living room environment. This project demonstrates real-time device interactions, 3D rendering, and interactive UI controls.

## Features

* **Room Lights**

  * On/Off toggle
  * Adjustable brightness (intensity slider)

* **Ceiling Fan**

  * Off / Low / High speed modes
  * Realistic rotating fan blades

* **Television**

  * On/Off toggle
  * Animated color effects when turned on

* **Air Conditioner (AC)**

  * Adjustable temperature (16°C – 30°C)
  * Dynamic AC display color (blue for cold, green for comfort, red for hot)
  * Room lighting hue changes based on temperature

* **3D Environment**

  * Living room with sofa, TV stand, walls, and floor
  * Dynamic camera movement (orbit, zoom, drag controls)
  * Soft shadows and realistic lighting

## Controls

* Mouse drag → Rotate view
* Scroll wheel → Zoom in/out
* UI panel (top-left) → Control devices

---

## Tech Stack

* Three.js (r128) – 3D rendering and animations
* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript – UI and interactivity
* WebGL – Hardware-accelerated graphics

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshitha-04/smart-home-3d.git
cd smart-home-3d
```

### 2. Run locally

**Option A: Open directly**

* Open `index.html` in your browser

**Option B: Run with Python server**

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Or Windows
py -m http.server 8000
```

Then open → [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html)

## Future Enhancements

* Add more smart devices (curtains, speakers, security system)
* Day/Night cycle with dynamic environment lighting
* Voice control integration
* Mobile-friendly controls
