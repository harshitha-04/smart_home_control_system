🏠 Smart Home 3D Simulation

A 3D interactive smart home simulation built with Three.js, where you can control lights, fan, TV, and AC in a virtual living room environment. This project demonstrates real-time device interactions, 3D rendering, and interactive UI controls.

✨ Features

Room Lights 💡

ON/OFF toggle

Adjustable brightness (intensity slider)

Ceiling Fan 🌀

OFF / LOW / HIGH speed modes

Realistic rotating fan blades

Television 📺

ON/OFF toggle

Animated color effects when ON

Air Conditioner (AC) ❄️🔥

Adjustable temperature (16°C – 30°C)

Dynamic AC display color (blue for cold, green for comfort, red for hot)

Room lighting hue changes based on temperature

3D Environment

Living room with sofa, TV stand, walls, and floor

Dynamic camera movement (orbit + zoom + drag controls)

Soft shadows and realistic lighting

🎮 Controls

Mouse Drag → Rotate view

Scroll Wheel → Zoom in/out

UI Panel (top-left) → Control devices

🛠️ Tech Stack

Three.js (r128) → 3D rendering and animations

HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript → UI and interactivity

WebGL → Hardware-accelerated graphics
